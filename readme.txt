1003 Mortgage Application provides a simple way for website owners to capture client information in a secure environment.

== Description ==

<strong>Introducing MISMO 3.4 Exports for Premium Users in version 1.70</strong>

<a href="https://mortgageapplicationplugin.com" target="_blank">Mortgage Application Plugin Website</a>

1003 Mortgage Application is a very easy-to-use wordpress plugin built with the purpose of providing financial industry professionals with a quick and easy way to capture client information. Our premium version also comes with a FNM 3.2 export, MISMO 3.4 export as well as webhooks to allow this data to be automatically posted to 3rd party applications, all while never requiring a user to login or create an account.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. WP installations have the settings available under the "MTG Application" menu item.
4. Configure your general settings and outbound email settings here from the General Settings tab.
5. Next you can configure the Form settings to display or hide almost any form field, save and make sure to test to ensure everything is coming through as you desire.
6. Once all the settings are configured you will copy the shortcode [mortgage_application_form] and place it on a page/post of your choice to show the  application.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require an SSL? =

Yes. While we don't capture any personal financial information, we do collect personal information about users and strongly believe it's a best practice to require our users to have a secure website to capture said information.

= Is this plugin free forever? =

Yes. However we do offer and upgraded version that comes with FNM 3.2 export capabilities along with webhooks functionality which allows you to post this data to any software or service with an open API at fractions of the cost of other providers.

= Can I edit the look of the application? =

Yes. We provide 2 color chooser boxes that will easily allow you to customize the branding of the application to your specs. Further customization is available but would require a basic understanding of CSS.
